It would be great to have Face Unlock on our system this save us time to enter password everytime we are logout. You can use this and easy have a face unlock. For now it only works on Ubuntu. It's concept is fairly simply. It extract usefull features from the image which it capture using the webcam into shape of (128,1). Then find eucliden distance from the real image. If the distance is less then 0.6 then it unlock the system otherwise keep waiting.
